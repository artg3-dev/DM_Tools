# Icons
The following are some icons I think I will need at some point during the creation of this program. The icons in bold are going in the launch version, and the others are for future ideas.
 - [ ] **Previous Player**
 - [ ] **Next Player**
 - [ ] **Restart**
 - [ ] **Exit**
 - [ ] **New Player**
 - [ ] **Edit Player**
 - [ ] **Adventuring Party**
 - [ ] Tools
 - [ ] Settings
 - [ ] **Combat**
 - [ ] **Conditions***
 - [ ] Weapons
 - [ ] Armor
 - [ ] Spells
 - [ ] Loot
 - [ ] World
 - [ ] Travel

*Conditions:
Conditions only need to be [smaller shape/color icons](https://i.ya-webdesign.com/images/colorful-circle-png-8.png) to mark on a players sheet that they have a condition. You don't need the color palette for this.
 - Blinded
 - Charmed
 - Deafened
 - Exhaustion
 - Frightened
 - Grappled
 - Incapacitated
 - Invisible
 - Paralyzed
 - Petrified
 - Poisoned
 - Prone
 - Restrained
 - Stunned
 - Unconscious

 


## Colors
 - **YELLOW** = #C2983D
 - **CHARCOAL** = #emphasized text262425
 - **DARKOAL** = #141314
 - **GREEN** = #303D38
 - **DARK_GREEN** = #1c2421
 - **BEIGE** = #928A74 **
 - **RED** = #380909

** Beige should be avoided for the most part; it will serve as the main background color.
## Naming
Icons should be named using the following format:
 - No numbers spaces or special characters
 - "IconName" + _ + "Use" 
 
> NewInitiative_Red_Default

> NextPlayer_Green_Hover

> LootGenerator_Blue_Click
