### Planned Features
Once this program is in a more polished state, the plan is to repackage just the DND libraries (i.e. not the GUI or application logic) as its own standalone project. This will allow others to make their own programs from it, without the need to sort through the GUI library.
 In addition, there are more plans for the current application. Please see the [Planned Features](https://github.com/artg3-dev/DM_Tools/blob/master/docs/PlannedFeatures.md) documentation for more info.
