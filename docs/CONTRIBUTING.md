# Contributing Guidelines
Before making any contributions, please see the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/artg3-dev/DM_Tools/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
## Bugs and Issues
If all you want to do is report a bug or issue, please go to the [issues](https://github.com/artg3-dev/DM_Tools/issues) tab of the Github repo and use the provided [template](https://github.com/artg3-dev/DM_Tools/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
## Code
Changes/additions to the code are welcome. Please check the [planned features](https://github.com/artg3-dev/DM_Tools/blob/master/docs/PlannedFeatures.md) or the [good first issues](https://github.com/artg3-dev/DM_Tools/issues?q=is:open%20is:issue%20label:%22good%20first%20issue%22) for ideas.
### Format
Please use Googles [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for Java naming / formatting standards. 
### Requirements
- All code submitted must include relevant javadoc comments.
- Pull requests should solve one problem / create one new feature at a time. If the feature requires multiple new additions, please break them up into separate and self-sustaining parts.
- Be thorough with pull request documentation. For now, all pull requests are being reviewed manually.
### Changes to existing code
For the time being, please refrain from changing any existing code *unless* you are fixing an existing, known bug. Until you have become a recognizable contributor, most pull-requests that change existing code will be denied. (This is not because the existing code is flawless. It is to prevent any potential issues until the project is more stable).
## Icons and Graphics
The program is in need of a makeover. For information regarding color-scheme and icon ideas, please see the [icon documentation](https://github.com/artg3-dev/DM_Tools/blob/master/docs/Icons.md). 
### Submitting Icons
If all you want to do is submit the icon .png files, fork the repository and create a folder within called *New Icons -yourusername-*. Submit a pull request with the title: 

> Icon Submission, *yourusername*, date (MM/DD/YYYY) 

If you are implementing new icons into the program itself, please see the [code guidelines](#code).
